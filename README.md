MACHINE LEARNING : Heart Diseases :
• Used logistic regression (classification) algorithm to classify if patients
have heart disease or not.
• Libraries and tools used numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn,
gridsearchcv.
• Output : tuned hyper-parameters, scatter-plot, confusion matrix (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score).

MACHINE LEARNING : AI in Autonomous Spacecraft Operations :
• Helped develop an AI model that determines the best path for a spacecraft to take based on sensor data and current conditions.
• Used numpy and Isolation Forests to efficiently manage data and detect
anomalies in spacecraft sensor readings.
• Participated in mission planning by turning real-time data into specific
actions for the spacecraft.
